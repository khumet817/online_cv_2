# online_cv_2
This my online cv. Its purpose is display a collection of my gained knowledge and showcase my life story since my high school years. It will detail my academic history, my skills and how to get in contact with me.

In my online CV, I have implemented css grids and laid out my content neatly. It has a brief introduction on who I am and what kind of person I am. It shows the journey I have taken by displaying my previous projects from my very first basic html project to my latest project.
